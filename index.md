## BACKGROUND

We first tried to recreate "Predicting digital asset market based on blockchain activity data" found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06696.pdf).

After multiple roadblocks, we were able to start the initial sync with Parity Client. After 24 hours at full CPU usage, the inital sync was not even half complete. 

As a result, we decided to recreate a similar project, "Predicting Cryptocurrency Prices With Deep Learning" found [here](https://dashee87.github.io/deep%20learning/python/predicting-cryptocurrency-prices-with-deep-learning/).

Although this second source is not technically a "research paper," it is a good example of real world experience with deep learning. It is also extremely readable and requires very little technical roadblocks to setup.
